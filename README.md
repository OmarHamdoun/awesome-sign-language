# Awesome Sign Language
ðŸ™Œ  A collection of awesome Sign Language projects and resources ðŸ¤Ÿ

[Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language) is a language that can include simultaneously employing hand gestures, movement, orientation of the fingers, arms or body, and facial expressions to convey a speaker's ideas. 

Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages have developed, and are at the cores of local deaf cultures. Find here the [list of Sign Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sign_languages).
